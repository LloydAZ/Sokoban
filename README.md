# Sokoban

Sokoban (which translates to "Warehouse Man") has simple rules, which basically amount to push the crates into 
their storage spots in the warehouse. 

The elements of the levels are simple: Player
                                       Crates
                                       Walls
                                       Open Floor
                                       Storage
				       
The symbols used to represent the elements are: # - Wall
                                                o - Crate
                                                @ - Player
                                                . - Storage
                                                * - Crate on Storage Space
                                                + - Player on Storage Space
                                      Blank Space - Open Floor
									   
The game is played by moving the man up, down, left and right. When the man moves towards a crate, he may push it 
along in front of him as long as there is no wall or second crate behind the one being pushed. A level is solved 
when all crates are on storage spaces.

The movement keys are: U or Up Arrow for Up
                       D or Down Arrow for Down
                       L or Left Arrow for Left
                       R or Right Arrow for Right
					   
If you mess up, you can restart the level by selecting 'X'
You can quit at any time by selecting 'Q'

I have included a folder that contains files for additional levels that can be modified and added to the game if you
would like additional challenges other than the levels I provided.
